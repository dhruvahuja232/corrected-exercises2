						<p>I congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night," Cruz said at the outset of his speech. 
						   "And like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November."
						   He never mentioned Trump’s name again. And for a while, his speech — which laid out the 
						   principles he personally believed in — was very well-received.
						   But as the speech stretched on without an endorsement, attendees began to repeatedly interrupt Cruz with 
						   shouts of "Trump!" and "We want Trump!"
						   Cruz didn’t give in. And when he wrapped up his endorsement-less remarks, he was booed off the stage in a truly 
						   remarkable scene.
